## Setting

Mid battle outside Manor with Scarecrow and ravens.

Hughye deals the final blow to the ravens and watches as the Scarecrow burns to death.

## Cellar

Otto opens the cellar door, and a group of rats flee. He checks the cellar corridor and sees nothing, but carries on to the end and a staircase which leads to the kitchen.

Athae notices writing on the wall in elvish, which says Death is the key.

Nothing is seen in the kitchen, and nothing more is seen in the cellar.

The group enters the corridor, and then the ballroom.

## Ballroom

Remains of corpses on the floor. These are the missing townsfolk. Three zombies attack.

Nephis kills zombie 1.

Hughye kills zombie 3.

Nephis kills zombie 2.

Halstron finds a petrified frog among the pile of bodies.

## Dining room

Empty. Barold pulls the tablecloth and throws the items everywhere.

## Study

A glamour dissippates as Athae enters and checks the desk. Barold removes a portrait of the lord and finds nothing. Otto checks the chair and finds an expensive black cloak. He wears it and returns to the parlour to play the piano. The poltergeist pauses and then rages further.

## Hall

Otto checks for traps, finds nothing, and pauses halfway up the stairs. Barold throws the table cloth and it falls off the suit of armour harmlessly. He takes the shield and the suits come to life.
