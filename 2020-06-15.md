## Setting

Begins in an inn.

Everyone is woken by a messenger. Called to Lord Lymas Winzor, mayor of Pernalia.

OP steals some feathers from room.

Everyone makes their way to the mayors house. All notice BB is not there. Party introduces selves.

## Mayor's house

Ushered into study. Short middle aged man with greying hair and trimmed beard sitting there.

"My name is Lymas Wimsoar." He explains Baralon Manor. It is a decrepit house on a hill outside of the town. Owned by Lord Baralon, an old friend of the mayor. Several months ago, vanished, and trouble started. No response at the manor, then a month later more disappearances. A mob marched on the manor but all vanished. People are leaving the town out of fear. Some claim he has gone mad and is practicing dark magic.

He requests that the party investigate the manor and find out the truth.

OP persuades for 250GP each.

Ask HB why he wants to be part of this group. HB says he was banished from his temple and is trying to reearn their respect.

BB stumbles into room to rejoin party.

Left with manservant Alfred. Party purchases items and equipment.

## Manor hill

Led out of the house and towards the end of town. He says that he would like to offer his knowledge and skills as far as the manor. He says Lord Baralon was generous to a fault.

The manor is large with 11 rooms, 3 bedrooms and several rooms downstairs including study, conservatory, a dining room, a ballroom, and a kitchen. The back garden and conservatory were highly renowned for variety of foods and plants grown there. There are various goings on at night time, anyone going close has gone missing. The locals believe dark magic is involved. The manor is surrounded by a high wall and the main garden is accessible by a gate at the front.

Alfred says he can provide further supplies to the top of the hill.

Enter house. Roll initiative.

3 Swarms of ravens attack.
