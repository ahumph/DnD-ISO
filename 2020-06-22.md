## Setting

Mid battle outside Manor.

3 Swarms of ravens.
Barold kills S2.
Otto kills S3.

A woodland nymph restores the party's health and disperses the final swarm.

### Parlour

Parlour has a piano that music can be heard from. Otto lights a fire. Checking piano shows it has not been played in a long time, there is nothing hidden within. Strangely drawn to it. A poltergeist goes into a rage and cannot be calmed down. The party eventually leaves the room.

### Conservatorium

The conservatorium has a fountain and a group of twig blights in the bushes. They attack when Athae approaches.

OP kills blight 3.
NH kills blights 2 and 6.
BB kills blight 5.
OP kills blight 1.
NH kills blight 4 by axe-ing it to the door.

### Garden
