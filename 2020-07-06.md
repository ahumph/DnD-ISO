## Setting

In the hallway of the manor, attacked by two suits of armour and two swords.

## Hall

Hughye rolls out of the way into the room on the right. Halstron follows him. Athae dashes after them.

Barold moves half way across the landing, and throws ball bearings and caltrops on the stairs where suit 3 and sword 2.

Otto moves behind Barold and fires an arrow at sword 2, shattering it into pieces.

Sword 1 attempts to sweep through Otto and Barold, but misses and lodges into the door.

Suit 3 moves carefully through the caltrops and bearings and strikes at Barold, but misses.

Suit 4 moves up the stairs, but falls and becomes prone.

Barold runs into the room, as does Otto, closing the door.

## Bedroom

A spirit of a young child (Charlize) is seen on the bed, with her throat slit. Nephis plays a song and she says that it was the song her mother used to play. Nephis asks if she would like to go see her mother, but she refuses, citing that her father told her to stay there until the men were gone.

She did not see the men clearly, but remembers two tall hooded figures. She says they're downstairs dealing with her father. Nephis asks if there's anything her mother likes. She says she's fond of playing the piano and spending time in the gardens.

The other rooms are the guest bedroom and the master bedroom. She does not know how to get to the floor above.

The group take a long rest.

She says the mother was always fond of flowers.

## Guest bedroom

Otto checks a fireplace in the centre of the room, and moves a candelabra. The fireplace moves out of the way to reveal a staircase. The group climbs it, and finds a secret room containing desks, a rocking chair, a chair, and shelves with various ledgers.

Lord Baralon's spirit appears.

An elf appears seeking shelter. Accompanied by two hooded friends. He sent daughter to her room and wife and he sat down for tea with the guests in the dining room. One of the cloaked figures attacked his wife and his memory is blank beyond that point. The party tell him that he and his family are now dead, and ask if there's anything they can do.

He says he regrets offering the strangers into his house. He thinks he fell victim to a horrible fate.

## Master Bedroom

The group find nothing of note in the bedroom. Nephis takes a small book of fiction. Otto takes some dead flowers to the poltergeist, which doesn't help at all.

## Cellar

Barold sees a zombie go through the wall in the cellar. He runs in a rage at the wall and slams into it.

Halstron takes the petrified frog, the group link arms, and enter the basement.
